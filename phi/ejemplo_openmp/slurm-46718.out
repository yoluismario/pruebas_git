RANDOM_NUMBER_CONTENTION
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  This program demonstrates a case where the use
  of multiple threads in OpenMP may DEGRADE the
  performance of a program.
 
  In this program, we simply call the FORTRAN90
  random number generator many times.
 
  Because that function has internal saved variables,
  when it is accessed by multile threads, there can
  be huge delays because the threads fight to gain
  access to the saved variables.
 
  The number of processors available:
  OMP_GET_NUM_PROCS () =      228
